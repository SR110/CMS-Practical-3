# Learning Activities & Resources
I spent this week learning about the nuances of the WordPress interface and acquired important knowledge about using WordPress, the selected content management system, to edit websites. A variety of instructional materials, such as interesting YouTube lessons and in-depth courses on LinkedIn Learning, enhanced my learning process.

# Estimated Hours
I spent around 5 hours learning about WordPress and web hosting and spent about 3 hours building the site.

# Content Insights
I learnt how to edit existing WordPress templates to meet the requirements of the website. The layout of the webpages had to be changed. Learning WordPress took most of the time and it was not as basic as I had imagined it to be. I watched a lot of videos for installation and editing the pages, adding columns and even restoring pages when I lost my work.
WordPress, I would say, is relatively easy when compared to other CMS Platforms like Joomla.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I can say that I have acquired some skills that help me inch faster towards better employability like the art of never giving up, looking for alternative methods of solving an issue and patience when the results are slow. If I continue acquiring such skills, this would greatly help in shaping me into a well-rounded individual who is work-ready and can solve any problem that I am faced with in an office setting.
